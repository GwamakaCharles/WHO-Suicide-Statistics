# WHO-Suicide-Statistics
Statistics for Suicide Analysis for all the countries in the world using Machine Learning Algorithms to find some interesting patterns, solutions and Clues about Suicides using Data Analysis and Data Visualizations

# Description

# Context and inspiration
This dataset was necessary for me to write my Suicide in the Twenty-First Century piece.

Looking at the data, you can observe long-time trends and differences between countries, as well as within countries across a few demographic groups - in both cases you will see that these differences may be very large.

# Content
Basic aggregate numbers covering 1979-2016, by country, year, age groups and sex. There is only one file, with only a few columns. I made this file using the WHO Mortality Database online tool.

# Acknowledgements and license
I prepared and uploaded the data file without WHO's knowledge, let alone approval or endorsement. Yet, the data itself belongs to WHO, so please see the WHO copyrights, permission and licensing pages if you want to use it.
